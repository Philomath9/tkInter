Design document

For the bottom keyboard we need 10 squarish cells
for the bottom keyboard row we need 7 squares in the middle and two 1.5 (horizontaly wider) cells for enter and backspace

For the game space we need area for 5 word guesses of length 4-7? With an 8th cell for indication of too long or too short of guesses

Websites should transform responsively and fast at all screen resolutions on different browsers and platforms. Accessible. Mobile-friendly. 
Design for your audience, first. Design from 360×640 through 1920×1080.

For the 360 case we can divide the gameboard cells up 360 / 8 / 45, so 45 if no buffer around edges.
With buffer 40 X 40 should be comfortable, which makes the game board part 40 X 8 320 pixels wide

For the keyboard portion we need smaller cells.  360 / 10 = 36 with no buffer around the edges
So...lets say 34? for 340 pixels total and a small buffer.

This would make the required vertical space (not counting dividers and such.
keyboard 34 X 3 = 102
gameboard 40 X 5 = 200

For a vertical requirement of 302 pixles.
Asthetically this squarish-ness is not asthetic pleaseing
Wordle uses 1170 X 1857 (Ratio from screenshot) and is asthetically pleaseing
If we keep a similar Ratio...
1170  360
1857   X
x= 571 - ish, So lets round up to 580 (Leaving a top banner of height 60 pixels)...perfect
So our starting canvas needs to be 360 X 640





================================
Some example padding code
import tkinter as tk

app = tk.Tk()

entryExample1 = tk.Entry(app)
entryExample2 = tk.Entry(app)

entryExample1.grid(row=0,
               column=0,
               padx=10,
               pady=10,
               ipady=30)

entryExample2.grid(row=1,
               column=0,
               padx=10,
               pady=10,
               ipadx=20,
               ipady=30)

app.geometry("200x200")

app.mainloop()

The geometry of Tkinter Entry widget with grid method is as below,

Tkinter Entry_width and height in grid method

The actual width of the Tkinter Entry is 2*ipadx + Default Entry width, similarly the actual width of Entry is 2*ipady + Default Entry height.
